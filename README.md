# Projects:

### POWER BI

#### Business Insights 360
<img align="left" width="300" height="200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dd2e04f-e582-40c0-9fc7-cfb22a1def9a"> **[Business Insights 360](https://github.com/prudhvi1029/Business-Insights-360)**
</p> In this project I implemented meticulous ETL process on AtliQ Hardware's 1.8 million transaction records from FY 2019 to FY 2022 and crafted a multi-view report for comprehensive analysis across 5 critical business domains: Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive using Power BI. By integrating key business metrics such as Net Sales, COGS, Gross Margin %, Net Profit % and Forecast Accuracy % the report offers a holistic view of AtliQ's performance.

#### Hospitality Analysis
<img align="left" width="300" height="200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be9973ac-da65-4ccf-93fd-13ac4ba4db75"> **[Hospitality Analysis](https://github.com/prudhvi1029/Hospitality-Domain-Project---Power-BI)**
</p> In this project, I stepped in to help AtliQ Grands, an imaginary company, as they were grappling with declining market share and revenue.They needed meaningful insights from their historical data to regain their competitive edge in the luxury/business hotel market. I crafted dashboards, created metrics, and delivered additional insights to support their strategic decision-making. I designed dashboards that showcased market share, revenue trends, booking patterns, and key KPIs for management, ultimately aiding their recovery efforts.

</p> In this project, I analyzed 3 months of data for AtliQ Grands, an imaginary company, to identify revenue loss and occupancy disparities across four cities. To help the hotel regain its competitive edge, I processed over 10,000 data points using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized the data, computing occupancy rates and examining city-specific revenue trends to optimize resource allocation and pricing strategies. I delivered actionable recommendations, including dynamic pricing, platform optimization, and seasonal campaigns, projected to boost revenue by 20% and improve occupancy rates.

</p> In this project, I collected, cleaned, and analyzed survey data from over 90,000 global software professionals using APIs, web scraping, and data wrangling techniques. Through robust preprocessing, I improved data reliability and reduced analysis errors by 20%. I conducted exploratory data analysis and created compelling visualizations using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. This helped uncover key trends in technology usage, emerging skills, and market demands. Additionally, I designed and implemented a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard in IBM Cognos , enabling stakeholders to interact with insights and make data-driven decisions.
